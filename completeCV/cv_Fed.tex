\vspace{2mm} \\ Postdoctoral Scholar in the Ocean Engineering department. Conducting analysis as part of two research projects in collaboration with the NOAA Alaska Fisheries Science Center:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Estimating the flux of walleye pollock between US and Russian sectors in the northwestern Bering Sea using data from a one-year deployment of seafloor mounted autonomous echosounders. Integrating observations with environmental data and model predictions of currents and environmental conditions.
    \item Analysis of discrepancies between broadband and narrowband volume scattering collected using Simrad EK80 echosounders. The goal of this work is to identify potential underlying causes of variability in integrated volume scattering as a result of differences in signal processing and provide guidance for use of broadband signals for use in acoustic-trawl surveys.
\end{itemize}
\vspace{2mm} Both of these projects include the development of both MATLAB- and Python-based tools for parsing and analyzing broadband data, in particular, calculating and classifying spectra from both bulk scattering and individual targets based on scattering models.}
