# LevineCV

This repository is a place to keep and maintain LaTeX formatted versions of my CV.

The [standard CV](https://github.com/leviner/LevineCV/blob/master/LevineCV.pdf) is based on [Dr. Harriet Alexander's `Long-Form`](https://github.com/halexand/Alexander_CV) CV, which is modified formatting of the [moderncv](https://github.com/xdanaux/moderncv).

Major formatting changes include the inclusion of year labels for all `.bib` items.
