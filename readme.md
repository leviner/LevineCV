# LevineCV

This repository is a place to keep and maintain LaTeX formatted versions of my CV.

The standard CV is a modified version of [Dr. Harriet Alexander's `Long-Form`](https://github.com/halexand/Alexander_CV) CV, which is modified formatting of the [moderncv](https://github.com/xdanaux/moderncv).
